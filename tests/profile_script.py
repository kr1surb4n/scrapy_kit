MAGIC IPYTHON FUNCTIONS FOR PROFILING

IPython has the following magic commands for profiling:

    %time: Shows how long a one or more lines of code take to run.
    %timeit: Like %time but gives an average from multiple runs. Option -n can be used to specify the number of runs. Depending on how long the program takes, the number of runs is limited automatically. This is unlike the timeit module.
    %prun: Shows time taken by each function.
    %lprun: Shows time taken line by line. Functions to profile can be specified with -f option.
    %mprun: Shows how much memory is used.
    %memit: Like %mprun but gives an average from multiple runs, which can be specified with -r option.

Commands %time and %timeit are available by default. Commands %lprun, %mprun and %memit are available via modules line-profiler, memory-profiler and psutil. But to use them within IPython as magic commands, mapping must be done via IPython extension files. Or use the %load_ext magic command.

When timing multiple lines of code, use %%timeit instead of %timeit. This is available for %prun as well.
